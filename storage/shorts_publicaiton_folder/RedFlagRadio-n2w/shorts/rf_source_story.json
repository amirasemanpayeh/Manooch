  "source_text": "I (26F) just had my first baby 3 months ago, and my mom (55F) has been... way too involved. At first, I thought it was sweet that she wanted to help so much, but lately she's been crossing some serious lines.\n\nLast week, she introduced my baby to her friend as 'our baby' and when I corrected her, she said 'Well, I'm the first mom. I raised you, so I know what I'm doing.' I was shocked.\n\nShe constantly critiques how I feed him, how I swaddle him, and even claims that the baby 'likes her more' because he stops crying when she holds him (he's literally just tired by then). When I tried to talk to her about boundaries, she snapped and said I was being ungrateful and that I clearly can't handle parenting alone.\n\nNow she's asking for a 'trial run' - she wants to take my baby overnight to 'prove she can do it better than me.' I feel like she doesn't see me as his parent, just as some kind of assistant to her being his 'real' mom.\n\nAITA for feeling like my own mother is trying to take over as my baby's parent?"
